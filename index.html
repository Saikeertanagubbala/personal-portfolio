        <p>My name is Sai Keertana Gubbala. As a student learning information science, I have always been fascinated in specific by the intersection of medicine and computer science. My academic choices, from choosing my courses to my co-curriculars in high school and college have been driven by my desire to understand the complex systems at play in living organisms and to use that knowledge to analyze human health. I am passionate about using this understaning of biotechnology to propel me forward in the field of Bioinformatics.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am a research analyst at <a href="https://www.myedmaster.com">MyEdMaster</a>. In my role, I specialize in analyzing scientific papers and extracting details to create insights while also using R programming language for statistical computing. </p>
        <p>My personal interests also include drawing, going to the gym, and having a boba milk tea in my free time.</p>
