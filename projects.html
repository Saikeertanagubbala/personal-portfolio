        <h3>Mini User Experience Project</h3>
        <p class="project-date">Jan 2023 - May 2023</p>
        <p>Conducted my own User Experience (UX) project by performing three contextual interviews on their note-taking practices. This involved immersing myself with the users' natural environments, and observing how they interacted with note-taking tools and techniques in real time. I then utilized software to effectively record and organize interview notes and ensure efficient data management. This then aided in the creation of debriefing notes and an affinity diagram using <a href="https://miro.com/">Miro</a>, visualizing patterns and generating potential design ideas based on the findings.</p>
